# End-to-End SIEM Pipeline: Detecting and Responding to Attacks Using Splunk and ELK Stack

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains a case study project focused on building and comparing an **End-to-End SIEM Pipeline** using **Splunk Enterprise Security** and the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**.  
The project demonstrates how logs flow through collection, processing, indexing, and visualization stages to detect and respond to simulated cyberattacks.

## 🎯 Project Focus
- Cybersecurity & Security Operations (SOC)
- Log Management & Data Analytics
- Threat Detection & Correlation
- SIEM Pipeline Implementation

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk Enterprise Security** (SPL queries, dashboards)
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats)
- **Virtual Lab Setup** (Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux)
- **Attack Simulation Tools**: Nmap, Metasploit, John the Ripper, SQL Injection

## 🔍 Key Features
- Detection of brute force login attempts
- Port scanning and reconnaissance detection
- SQL injection and exploitation monitoring
- Comparative analysis of Splunk vs ELK (ratings, strengths, weaknesses)
- Future scope: SOAR integration for automated response

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `CaseStudy.md` → Full case study document
- `CaseStudy.pdf`
## 📈 Results
- Splunk excels in **UEBA** and user-friendly dashboards.
- ELK provides **scalability** and **cost-effectiveness** with open-source flexibility.
- Both pipelines successfully detected simulated attacks in real-time.
